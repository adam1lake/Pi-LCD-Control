# Pi-LCD
A simple interface to common 16x2 Raspberry Pi LCD screens (HD44780).
Includes useful features such as:
- Text display
- Timeouts and delays
- Text scrolling
- Threading to allow for control of both lines separately
- Logic to prevent display "glitches" when performing multiple operations at once
